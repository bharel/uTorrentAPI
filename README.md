# uTorrentAPI
Controlling uTorrent WebUI (WebAPI) using python's asyncio.
Keep in mind this is an unofficial api client, not endorsed and without any connection to uTorrent's development team.

**uTorrent's WebAPI's documentation is outdated. You can have a look at it but I highly suggest reading the documentation of my module as it is more up-to-date regarding fields and parameters. I've marked some fields as unknown throughout the module as they're undocumented.**
